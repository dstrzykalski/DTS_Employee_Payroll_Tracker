This Repository Contains my Submission for the Weel 3 JS Challenge.
In this Challenge I was Tasked with Creating a Working Function that Could Store Employee Name and Salary Data.
The User Would Input the Number of Employees and Their Corresponding Name and Salary Information.
This Data Would Then Reflect onto the Table on Screen.
Features to Randomly Generate and Employee and Their Corresponding Information were Also Included to Show in the Console Section of the Page.
